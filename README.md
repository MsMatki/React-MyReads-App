# MyReads App Project by Udacity

MyReads is a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. This project emphasizes the use of React with a given API server. 

## How To Use
The main page shows a control that allows you to move books between shelves. The search page allows users to search for new books to add to their shelves. To access the search page select the plus icon located at the bottom right of the page. Type in the search field for possible books to be found. Once loaded you may choose which shelf to send a book to by clicking on the green circle with a down arrow of any book.

## Important
